## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability in this project, please report it in the security issue tracker under the [SECURITY](https://continuousengineeringproject.myjetbrains.com/youtrack/newIssue?project=SEC) project. **Please do not report security issues in the github tracker.**

This project is configured in such a way that only the reporter and the security team can see the details. By restricting access to this potentially sensitive information, we can work on a fix and deliver it before the method of attack becomes well-known.

If you are unable to report using the above issue tracker, you can also send your report to the private Continuous Engineering Project security team mailing list: security@continuousengineeringproject.org

## Vulnerabilities in Apps

Whilst the Continuous Engineering Project team is not responsible for the quality of third party apps, please still use the above reporting mechanism and we will co-ordinate with the app developer to ensure a fix in a secure maner.
